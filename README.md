The purpose of this project is to have a way to easily create a logo for my projects

## Description
  
  The Build One Generate One Logo generator is a quick and easy way to generate a simple logo for any project. Upon running the file in node, the user will be prompted with questions requiring input. Questions relating to color can be responded to in color names or hex numbers, and text content allows up to 3 characters. After successfully completing the prompts, the user will be greeted with a message confirming success and can find their new file in the logos folder with a timestamp label. Open the new logo file in the browser will reveal the logo svg image.

## Installation
  
  The user must first locate the BOGO-LOGO folder in the command line. After doing so, the user need only run "npm i" to install the necessary packages, and await completion, then run "node index.js" to initialize and run the program. The user will then see the prompts to begin creating their logo.
  
## Usage
  
  In the command line inside the BOGO-LOGO folder, run "npm i", wait for completion, and then run "node index.js" and answer prompt questions. 'Color' questions can be answered with colors or hex values alone.
